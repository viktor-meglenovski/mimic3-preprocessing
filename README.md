# Preprocessing data from the MIMIC-III database

In this research we have extracted data about patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012, which is stored in a separate directories in MIMIC-III Clinical Database and filtered by PPG and SpO2 signals. The data is separated in two categories (folders) based on the interval in which SpO2 signal is measured â€“ one second or one minute. The filtered data is stored on a FCSE server and has private access. So far we have stored 340 GB of filtered data, which is approximately data for 2100 patients.
